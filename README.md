## Generative Dog Images Kaggle Mini-Project
This is the assignment of CU Boulder's *Introduction to Deep Learning*, Week 5 : Autoencoders and GANs.

### About dataset
A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning system invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. Two neural networks compete with each other in a game. Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set.

In this competition, we will be training generative models to create images of dogs. We will submit the images and be scored based on how well those images are classified as dogs from pre-trained neural networks.
